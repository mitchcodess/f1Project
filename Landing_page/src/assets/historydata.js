    description: `The 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix will forever be etched in Formula 1 history as a race of unparalleled drama and controversy. It was a climactic showdown between Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton for the World Drivers' Championship. The race unfolded with strategic twists, late-race safety car deployments, and a decision not to allow lapped cars to unlap themselves, setting the stage for a breathtaking final lap. In an audacious move, Max Verstappen, driving for Red Bull Racing, managed to pass Lewis Hamilton, who was defending his championship in a Mercedes, on the very last lap of the race, clinching not only the race win but also the coveted championship title by just a single point. The outcome of this race sparked intense debates, passionate celebrations, and deep disappointment among fans, making it one of the most talked-about and controversial moments in the history of Formula 1.`
